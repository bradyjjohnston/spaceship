The Open-Source Modular Controller (OSMC) project focuses on designing a flexible, modular input device architecture built around swappable hardware modules and open firmware. Its goal is to provide a customizable alternative to fixed-layout controllers, enabling users, hobbyists, and developers to tailor input devices to specific applications.
