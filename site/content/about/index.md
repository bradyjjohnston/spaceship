title: "I'm Brady, an electrical engineer and maker of random stuff."
---

I have been interested in computers and electronics for as long as I can remember. What started as curiosity turned into hands-on engineering through building, breaking, and iterating on real systems.

I am currently studying electrical engineering and working on a mix of hardware and software projects, including embedded systems, motor controllers, custom PCBs, and the tools that support them. This site is a place to document that work, share technical notes, and reflect on design decisions along the way.

Outside of coursework and projects, I focus on building things that are reliable, efficient, and well designed. I am especially interested in the balance between performance, clarity, and practical engineering.
